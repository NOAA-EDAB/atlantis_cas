<p>The remaining ports (other than the ports listed above) make up ~10%
of total landings. All trips associated with these ports will be
combined to form one fleet which will fish in the footprint below. This
maintains the communities at sea idea for the main ports but takes into
account all remaining landings to satisfy model requirements</p>

<p>The effort variable is Days at sea (DAS) and is a crude metric. Only
integer values and rounded up to the nearest whole day. It is the length
of the trip. Note: For each record of a trip (multiple records based on
the species caught) the DAS is replicated, so to calculate the true DAS
we need to find distinct Trip-DAS</p>
<p>After aggregating the top ports based on the decisions found in this
section {#sel} and combining all remaining ports into an “other fleet”
we can look at the total effort by fleet in units: days at sea</p>
