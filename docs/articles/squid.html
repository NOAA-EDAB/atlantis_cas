<p>Squid pose a data problem since they are caught primarily with the
same gear as the <a href="articles/groundfishNEFleet">NE groundfish</a>.
A method is required to identify squid trips and to separate these trips
from the groundfish trips. Failure to do so will potentially skew the
footprint and the effort for the NE groundfish fleet.</p>
<p>Difference between groundfish and squid fishers</p>
<ul>
<li>squid fishers use a smaller mesh net</li>
