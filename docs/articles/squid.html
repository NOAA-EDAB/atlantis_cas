<p>Squid pose a data problem since they are caught primarily with the
same gear as the <a href="articles/groundfishNEFleet">NE groundfish</a>.
A method is required to identify squid trips and to separate these trips
from the groundfish trips. Failure to do so will potentially skew the
footprint and the effort for the NE groundfish fleet.</p>
<p>Some squid fishers (Bigger boats) will travel anywhere to catch
squid. The limiting factor is gas prices. And depending on the permits
they hold they can change the gear and fish other species. Smaller boats
catching squid can not travel anywhere and are limited to smaller
region.</p>
<p>Difference between groundfish and squid fishers</p>
<ul>
<li>squid fishers use a smaller mesh net but the mesh size field in the
database is often missing so it is unreliable as a source for filtering
the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stock assessment determine a squid trip (after consulting industry)
using these rules of thumb:</p>
<ul>
<li>10,000 lbs of shortfin (Illex) (ISQ)</li>
<li>2,500 lbs of longfin (LSQ)</li>
</ul>
<p>This has not yet been implemented</p>
